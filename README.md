This spreadsheet depicts the how to calculate the salaries of certain employees in a company using Microsoft Excel.

The names, hourly wage and hours worked were randomly inputted. However, formulas were used to calculate the regular pay of the employees. For the overtime hours worked, a conditional if statement was used to determine that.
