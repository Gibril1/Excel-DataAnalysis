# Excel-DataAnalysis
___
This spreadsheet depicts the how to calculate the salaries of certain employees in a company using Microsoft Excel.

The names, hourly wage and hours worked were randomly inputted. However, formulas were used to calculate the regular pay of the employees. For the overtime hours worked, a conditional if statement was used to determine that. 

As a beginner in using excel for data analysis, these were the lessons that I learnt from this project.
1. Input into Cell
1. Absolute and relative referencing
1. Formulas In Excel such as Max, Min, Sum and Average
